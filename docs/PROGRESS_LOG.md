**Entry Title:** Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation - Substantially Complete

**Summary:**
Significant progress has been made, and "Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation" as outlined in the `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md` is now considered substantially complete. This includes the establishment of the development environment, project structure, a robust core SPICE integration module (`SpiceHandler`), initial data structures, comprehensive testing for the SPICE handler, and logging setup. The groundwork laid in this phase is solid, enabling the project to move confidently into "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core."

**Detailed Progress on Phase 0 Tasks (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

1.  **Environment & Version Control (NFR9, NFR8.6):** **Complete.**
    * Git repository is initialized and actively used (inferred from recent push activity).
    * Python virtual environment is in use (Python 3.10.8, as per `requirements.txt` and pytest logs).
    * Dependency management via `requirements.txt` is established, including core dependencies: Python, NumPy, SpiceyPy, pytest.

2.  **Project Structure (NFR1.1):** **Complete.**
    * The defined top-level directory structure (`src/` (formerly `lcforge/`), `tests/`, `docs/`, `data/spice_kernels/`) is in place and populated.
    * Initial placeholder files/modules like `src/spice/spice_handler.py` and `src/core/common_types.py` have been created and developed.

3.  **Core SPICE Handler (FR2.1):** **Complete & Exceeds Initial Requirements.**
    * The `src/spice/spice_handler.py` module has been implemented and extensively refined.
    * **Kernel Loading:** Robustly loads/unloads SPICE metakernels (handling multi-line definitions) and individual kernels.
    * **Time Conversions:** Provides reliable UTC to ET and ET to UTC conversions.
    * **Ephemeris & Orientation:** Retrieves positions of celestial bodies/spacecraft (`get_body_position`) and target orientation matrices (`get_target_orientation`).
    * **Frame Information:** Successfully retrieves frame names and IDs (`get_frame_name_from_id`, `get_frame_id_from_name`) and detailed frame information (`get_frame_info_by_id`), including adaptation to the specific 3-item return from `spiceypy.frinfo` in the `spiceypy 6.0.0` environment.
    * **Context Management:** Implements the context manager protocol (`__enter__`, `__exit__`) for automatic cleanup of loaded kernels.

4.  **Basic Data Structures (FR1):** **Initiated.**
    * The file `src/core/common_types.py` exists, suggesting that preliminary definitions for structures like `Epoch`, `Vector3D`, `Satellite`, etc., as mentioned in the plan, have been started or considered. Further development will occur in Phase 1.

5.  **Testing & CI Setup (NFR7):** **Substantially Complete for Core SPICE Handler.**
    * `pytest` framework is set up and used.
    * A comprehensive test suite (`tests/spice/test_spice_handler.py`) validates the `SpiceHandler` module, including metakernel loading, time conversions, position/orientation retrieval, frame info, and context management. All tests are currently passing.
    * CI setup is optional for Phase 0 and can be addressed later.

6.  **Logging Setup (FR7.4):** **Complete.**
    * Basic logging using Python's `logging` module is implemented within `spice_handler.py`, providing useful diagnostics.

**Phase 0 Deliverables Status (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

* Initialized and configured Git repository: **Achieved.**
* A basic, runnable project skeleton: **Achieved.**
* `spice_handler` module capable of loading SPICE kernels and retrieving basic ephemeris data: **Achieved and Exceeded.** (Also handles orientation and detailed frame info).
* Initial data class definitions: **Initiated** (via `src/core/common_types.py`).
* Working development environment with testing configured: **Achieved.**

**Current Overall Status:**
Phase 0 is substantially complete. The core functionalities related to SPICE data handling are implemented, debugged, and tested. The project is now well-prepared to proceed with "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core" as outlined in the `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`.

**Entry Title:** Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core - Catch-up Log for Initial Tasks

**Summary:**
This entry rectifies a missing update in the progress log. Significant work on "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core" has been completed following Phase 0. This includes the definition of core data structures for satellite modeling (`Satellite`, `Component`, `Facet`, `BRDFMaterialProperties` in `src/models/model_definitions.py`). Key functionalities for loading 3D mesh files (via `src/utils/mesh_utils.py`) and robust model persistence through YAML serialization/deserialization (via `src/io/model_io.py`) are now in place.

**Detailed Progress on Phase 1 Tasks (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

1.  **Satellite & Component Definition (`models.model_definitions` module - FR1.1, FR1.2, FR1.4):** **Substantially Complete.**
    * Core classes `Satellite`, `Component`, `Facet`, and `BRDFMaterialProperties` are defined in `src/models/model_definitions.py`.
    * These definitions support a component-based architecture, references to mesh files for shadowing, facet definitions for light curve calculations, and assignment of BRDF material properties. This is evidenced by their successful usage and serialization/deserialization in `src/io/model_io.py`.

2.  **Mesh Handling (FR1.1, NFR8.3):** **Complete.**
    * The `trimesh` library has been integrated for mesh operations.
    * The module `src/utils/mesh_utils.py` provides the `load_mesh_from_file` function, capable of loading various mesh formats (e.g., STL, OBJ) and extracting basic properties. The utility includes error handling and logging.

3.  **Component Geometry & Hierarchy (FR1.3):** **Initiated.**
    * The `Component` dataclass (defined in `src/models/model_definitions.py`) includes fields for `relative_position` (as `np.ndarray`) and `relative_orientation` (as `np.quaternion`). This establishes the foundation for defining component positions and orientations relative to the satellite body-fixed frame.

4.  **Model Persistence (FR1.5):** **Complete.**
    * A YAML-based file format has been designed and implemented for saving and loading complete `Satellite` model definitions.
    * The `src/io/model_io.py` module contains `save_satellite_to_yaml` and `load_satellite_from_yaml` functions for this purpose.
    * Custom YAML representers and constructors have been implemented for `numpy.ndarray`, `numpy.quaternion`, and the project's specific model dataclasses (`Satellite`, `Component`, `Facet`, `BRDFMaterialProperties`) to ensure accurate and robust serialization and deserialization.
    * The implementation in `src/io/model_io.py` includes an example usage section that also serves as a basic verification of the save/load functionality.

**Phase 1 Deliverables Status (Partial - referring to `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

* `models.model_definitions` module: Ability to programmatically define a multi-component satellite: **Achieved.**
* `articulation.articulator` module: **Not Yet Started.**
* Ability to save and load satellite model definitions from files: **Achieved.**
* Comprehensive unit tests for new modeling functionalities: **To Be Done** (though `model_io.py` contains an example/test script).

**Current Overall Status:**
Phase 1 of the project is actively underway, with several key foundational elements for satellite modeling now successfully implemented. The project can define, represent, load mesh geometry for, and persist satellite models. Future work in this phase will focus on component articulation, deeper integration with kinematics, and the development of thorough unit tests for these modules.
