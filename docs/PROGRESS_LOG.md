# Project lcforge: Progress Log

This document tracks the development progress of the `lcforge` project, referencing the "Development Plan: Satellite Light Curve Generation & Estimation (Rewrite)" (dated 2025-05-19). Its purpose is to provide a quick overview of completed milestones and the current stage of development.

**Entry Title:** Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation - Substantially Complete

**Summary:**
Significant progress has been made, and "Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation" as outlined in the `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md` is now considered substantially complete. This includes the establishment of the development environment, project structure, a robust core SPICE integration module (`SpiceHandler`), initial data structures, comprehensive testing for the SPICE handler, and logging setup. The groundwork laid in this phase is solid, enabling the project to move confidently into "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core."

**Detailed Progress on Phase 0 Tasks (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

1.  **Environment & Version Control (NFR9, NFR8.6):** **Complete.**
    * Git repository is initialized and actively used (inferred from recent push activity).
    * Python virtual environment is in use (Python 3.10.8, as per `requirements.txt` and pytest logs).
    * Dependency management via `requirements.txt` is established, including core dependencies: Python, NumPy, SpiceyPy, pytest.

2.  **Project Structure (NFR1.1):** **Complete.**
    * The defined top-level directory structure (`src/` (formerly `lcforge/`), `tests/`, `docs/`, `data/spice_kernels/`) is in place and populated.
    * Initial placeholder files/modules like `src/spice/spice_handler.py` and `src/core/common_types.py` have been created and developed.

3.  **Core SPICE Handler (FR2.1):** **Complete & Exceeds Initial Requirements.**
    * The `src/spice/spice_handler.py` module has been implemented and extensively refined.
    * **Kernel Loading:** Robustly loads/unloads SPICE metakernels (handling multi-line definitions) and individual kernels.
    * **Time Conversions:** Provides reliable UTC to ET and ET to UTC conversions.
    * **Ephemeris & Orientation:** Retrieves positions of celestial bodies/spacecraft (`get_body_position`) and target orientation matrices (`get_target_orientation`).
    * **Frame Information:** Successfully retrieves frame names and IDs (`get_frame_name_from_id`, `get_frame_id_from_name`) and detailed frame information (`get_frame_info_by_id`), including adaptation to the specific 3-item return from `spiceypy.frinfo` in the `spiceypy 6.0.0` environment.
    * **Context Management:** Implements the context manager protocol (`__enter__`, `__exit__`) for automatic cleanup of loaded kernels.

4.  **Basic Data Structures (FR1):** **Initiated.**
    * The file `src/core/common_types.py` exists, suggesting that preliminary definitions for structures like `Epoch`, `Vector3D`, `Satellite`, etc., as mentioned in the plan, have been started or considered. Further development will occur in Phase 1.

5.  **Testing & CI Setup (NFR7):** **Substantially Complete for Core SPICE Handler.**
    * `pytest` framework is set up and used.
    * A comprehensive test suite (`tests/spice/test_spice_handler.py`) validates the `SpiceHandler` module, including metakernel loading, time conversions, position/orientation retrieval, frame info, and context management. All tests are currently passing.
    * CI setup is optional for Phase 0 and can be addressed later.

6.  **Logging Setup (FR7.4):** **Complete.**
    * Basic logging using Python's `logging` module is implemented within `spice_handler.py`, providing useful diagnostics.

**Phase 0 Deliverables Status (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

* Initialized and configured Git repository: **Achieved.**
* A basic, runnable project skeleton: **Achieved.**
* `spice_handler` module capable of loading SPICE kernels and retrieving basic ephemeris data: **Achieved and Exceeded.** (Also handles orientation and detailed frame info).
* Initial data class definitions: **Initiated** (via `src/core/common_types.py`).
* Working development environment with testing configured: **Achieved.**

**Current Overall Status:**
Phase 0 is substantially complete. The core functionalities related to SPICE data handling are implemented, debugged, and tested. The project is now well-prepared to proceed with "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core" as outlined in the `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`.
