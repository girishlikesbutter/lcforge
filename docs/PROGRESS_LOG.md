**Entry Title:** Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation - Substantially Complete

**Summary:**
Significant progress has been made, and "Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation" as outlined in the `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md` is now considered substantially complete. This includes the establishment of the development environment, project structure, a robust core SPICE integration module (`SpiceHandler`), initial data structures, comprehensive testing for the SPICE handler, and logging setup. The groundwork laid in this phase is solid, enabling the project to move confidently into "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core."

**Detailed Progress on Phase 0 Tasks (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

**Entry Title:** Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core - Catch-up Log for Initial Tasks

**Summary:**
This entry rectifies a missing update in the progress log. Significant work on "Phase 1: Satellite Modeling Core" has been completed following Phase 0. This includes the definition of core data structures for satellite modeling (`Satellite`, `Component`, `Facet`, `BRDFMaterialProperties` in `src/models/model_definitions.py`). Key functionalities for loading 3D mesh files (via `src/utils/mesh_utils.py`) and robust model persistence through YAML serialization/deserialization (via `src/io/model_io.py`) are now in place.

**Detailed Progress on Phase 1 Tasks (referencing `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

1.  **Satellite & Component Definition (`models.model_definitions` module - FR1.1, FR1.2, FR1.4):** **Substantially Complete.**
    * Core classes `Satellite`, `Component`, `Facet`, and `BRDFMaterialProperties` are defined in `src/models/model_definitions.py`.
    * These definitions support a component-based architecture, references to mesh files for shadowing, facet definitions for light curve calculations, and assignment of BRDF material properties. This is evidenced by their successful usage and serialization/deserialization in `src/io/model_io.py`.

2.  **Mesh Handling (FR1.1, NFR8.3):** **Complete.**
    * The `trimesh` library has been integrated for mesh operations.
    * The module `src/utils/mesh_utils.py` provides the `load_mesh_from_file` function, capable of loading various mesh formats (e.g., STL, OBJ) and extracting basic properties. The utility includes error handling and logging.

3.  **Component Geometry & Hierarchy (FR1.3):** **Initiated.**
    * The `Component` dataclass (defined in `src/models/model_definitions.py`) includes fields for `relative_position` (as `np.ndarray`) and `relative_orientation` (as `np.quaternion`). This establishes the foundation for defining component positions and orientations relative to the satellite body-fixed frame.

4.  **Model Persistence (FR1.5):** **Complete.**
    * A YAML-based file format has been designed and implemented for saving and loading complete `Satellite` model definitions.
    * The `src/io/model_io.py` module contains `save_satellite_to_yaml` and `load_satellite_from_yaml` functions for this purpose.
    * Custom YAML representers and constructors have been implemented for `numpy.ndarray`, `numpy.quaternion`, and the project's specific model dataclasses (`Satellite`, `Component`, `Facet`, `BRDFMaterialProperties`) to ensure accurate and robust serialization and deserialization.
    * The implementation in `src/io/model_io.py` includes an example usage section that also serves as a basic verification of the save/load functionality.

**Phase 1 Deliverables Status (Partial - referring to `PROJECT_DEV_PLAN.md`):**

* `models.model_definitions` module: Ability to programmatically define a multi-component satellite: **Achieved.**
* `articulation.articulator` module: **Not Yet Started.**
* Ability to save and load satellite model definitions from files: **Achieved.**
* Comprehensive unit tests for new modeling functionalities: **To Be Done** (though `model_io.py` contains an example/test script).

**Current Overall Status:**
Phase 1 of the project is actively underway, with several key foundational elements for satellite modeling now successfully implemented. The project can define, represent, load mesh geometry for, and persist satellite models. Future work in this phase will focus on component articulation, deeper integration with kinematics, and the development of thorough unit tests for these modules.

**Entry Title:** POC Development: Programmatic Geometry, Kinematics, and Shadowing Analysis Setup

**Summary:**
Today's session focused on rapidly developing a proof-of-concept (POC) script (`poc_scripts/poc_phase1_geometry_definition.py`) to cover key aspects of satellite geometry definition, visualization, SPICE-based kinematics, and the initial implementation of self-shadowing analysis.

**Detailed Progress on POC Script Development:**

1.  **Programmatic Satellite Geometry Definition (Phase 1):**
    * Successfully implemented a method for users to define satellite components (e.g., bus, solar panels for IS901) by specifying their conceptual polygonal "faces" (N-gons) via Python lists of 3D vertices in local component frames.
    * Developed a helper function (`create_triangular_facets_from_conceptual_face`) to perform fan triangulation on these conceptual faces, converting them into a list of `Facet` objects (each representing a triangle with calculated normals and areas).
    * Utilized the existing `Component` and `Satellite` dataclasses to construct the `is901_satellite_manual` model object, populating components with these triangular facets.

2.  **Trimesh Conversion and Initial Visualization (Phase 1):**
    * Implemented a function (`component_to_trimesh`) to convert each `Component` object into a `trimesh.Trimesh` mesh. This included an option for conditional subdivision (tested by subdividing the bus but not the solar panels in the final version of the day).
    * Successfully applied relative transformations (position and orientation) to place component meshes into the satellite's body-fixed frame.
    * Assembled and visualized the complete satellite model in an initial `trimesh.Scene` (`satellite_scene`), including colored XYZ axes for reference. This visualization was used iteratively to refine the satellite's dimensions and component placements to a satisfactory state.
    * Functionality to display triangle edges (wireframe) was added to both initial and planned final visualizations for better clarity.

3.  **SPICE Kinematics for Sun Vector (Phase 2):**
    * Integrated the `SpiceHandler` to dynamically load the `INTELSAT_901-metakernel.tm` using a relative path from the script's location.
    * For a specified UTC epoch ("2020-02-05T12:00:00"), the script now successfully:
        * Converts UTC to Ephemeris Time.
        * Retrieves the Sun's position vector relative to the satellite (using its SPICE ID -126824) in the J2000 inertial frame.
        * Retrieves the satellite's orientation matrix (J2000 to `IS901_BUS_FRAME`).
        * Calculates the normalized `sun_direction_in_body_frame`.
    * This phase involved debugging and correcting several `AttributeError` and `TypeError` issues related to `SpiceHandler` method calls and initialization.

4.  **Shadowing Analysis and Visualization Setup (Phase 3):**
    * **Core Logic:**
        * Successfully concatenated all transformed component meshes into a single `full_satellite_trimesh` for global ray tracing.
        * Created a `trimesh.ray.ray_triangle.RayMeshIntersector` for this unified mesh.
        * Implemented the primary shadow calculation loop:
            * Iterates through each triangle of each component.
            * Performs back-face culling based on the triangle's normal relative to the `sun_direction_in_body_frame`.
            * For potentially illuminated triangles, it casts a ray from the triangle's centroid (with an adaptive offset based on overall satellite scale) towards the Sun.
            * Uses the intersector to check for occlusions, including an attempted fix for "surface acne" by checking ray intersection distance (though this did not fully resolve visual artifacts on solar panels in earlier iterations).
            * Populates a `triangle_shadow_status` dictionary with binary (0.0 for illuminated, 1.0 for shadowed) results.
    * **Visualization of Shadowed Scene:**
        * The script sets up a new `shadow_visualization_scene`.
        * It iterates through components, colors their triangles based on `triangle_shadow_status` (attempting red for shadowed, grey for illuminated), and adds them to this scene.
        * The final version of the script provided by the user includes logic to add XYZ axes and sun ray indicators (using `trimesh.path.Path3D` as a fallback for `trimesh.creation.arrow`) to this shadow scene.
        * The script also includes calls to helper functions (`add_xyz_axes_to_scene` and `set_custom_camera_view`) for the shadow scene visualization.
    * **Output:** The script prints the `triangle_shadow_status` list to the console. The log from the final provided script indicates that the (unsubdivided) solar panels are calculated as fully "Illuminated (0.0)".

**Current Status & Issues at End of Day (May 21, 2025):**
* Phases 1 and 2 of the POC (geometry definition, initial visualization, SPICE kinematics) are functioning correctly as per the last script version provided.
* The core shadow calculation logic (Phase 3.2) is in place and successfully populates the `triangle_shadow_status` dictionary. The diagnostic step of not subdividing solar panels resulted in them being calculated as "Illuminated".
* The main outstanding issue is the visual representation in Phase 3.3:
    * The user reported that visual artifacts ("red slivers") on solar panels persisted through several attempted fixes (adjusting ray origin epsilon, checking intersection distance). The final script version (where solar panels are not subdivided and calculated as illuminated) needs to be visually checked by the user to confirm if these specific slivers are gone or if another visual issue is present.
    * The script, as last provided by the user, would encounter a `NameError` for `add_xyz_axes_to_scene` (and `set_custom_camera_view`) and an `AttributeError` for `trimesh.creation.text_to_mesh3d` during the setup of the shadowed scene visualization, because the definitions for these helper functions and a fallback for text creation were not yet part of that script's top-level definitions.
* The immediate next step for the POC is to ensure a clean execution of the complete Phase 3 shadowed scene visualization by defining any missing helper functions, handling potential `trimesh` function `AttributeErrors` gracefully (e.g., for `text_to_mesh3d` and `arrow`), and then re-evaluating the visual accuracy of the shadowing, particularly on the solar panels.

**Entry Title:** POC Script: Shadowing Logic and Visualization Refinement

**Summary:**
Today's session was dedicated to intensive debugging and refinement of the self-shadowing calculation and visualization within the `poc_phase1_geometry_definition.py` script. The primary goal was to ensure that the visual representation of shadowed and illuminated faces accurately reflected the underlying calculated shadow status. Key issues addressed included visual artifacts making lit faces appear shadowed, and ensuring the ray-casting logic for self-shadowing was behaving as expected.

**Detailed Progress on POC Script (`poc_phase1_geometry_definition.py`):**

1.  **Visualization Accuracy Resolved:**
    * Identified that visual artifacts (e.g., "red glow" on front faces) were primarily due to rendering effects (like smooth shading) when differently colored faces (e.g., red back-faces, grey front-faces) were in close proximity.
    * **Fix:** Implemented `shadow_visualization_scene.show(smooth=False)` to use flat shading, which resolved the misleading color blending and provided a clear, accurate visual representation of the per-face shadow status.
    * Changed the color for "illuminated" faces to bright green for better contrast against red (shadowed) and yellow (ignored self-hit) during debugging.

2.  **Shadow Calculation Logic - Back-Face Handling:**
    * Modified the logic to correctly classify triangles facing away from the sun (based on dot product of their normal and the sun vector) as directly "shadowed" (status `1.0`). These faces do not cast further rays for self-shadowing.

3.  **Shadow Calculation Logic - Ray Casting for Front-Faces:**
    * Addressed an issue where "NO HITS" were being reported for rays cast from front-facing triangles, even when self-occlusion was expected.
    * Systematically debugged ray casting parameters:
        * Adjusted `epsilon_offset_val` (for ray origin) to `effective_scale * 1e-3` to provide a more robust offset from the surface.
        * Refined `min_occlusion_dist` to `epsilon_offset_val * 5.0` to better distinguish true occlusions from self-hits.
    * Corrected the `comp_rays_cast_count` statistic to ensure it only counted rays cast from truly front-facing triangles.
    * Ensured Trimesh objects were correctly processed using `mesh.process()` after initial creation and before `fix_normals` and `merge_vertices`.
    * Temporarily simplified the intersector mesh to include only the bus to isolate self-shadowing behavior, then reverted to using all components.

4.  **Subdivision and Intersector:**
    * Re-enabled subdivision for the bus geometry (`SUBDIVIDE_BUS_GEOMETRY = True`).
    * Ensured the `RayMeshIntersector` uses the complete satellite model (all components) for intersection tests.

5.  **Code Tidiness:**
    * Removed most of the highly verbose debugging `print` statements from the script.
    * Retained essential status messages, per-component shadow calculation statistics, and the final overall shadow status summary to maintain clarity on the script's operation.

**Current Status & Next Steps for POC:**
* The `poc_phase1_geometry_definition.py` script now correctly:
    * Defines satellite geometry.
    * Obtains kinematic data from SPICE.
    * Marks back-facing triangles as shadowed.
    * Casts rays for front-facing triangles to detect occlusions.
    * Visualizes the shadow status accurately using flat shading and distinct colors.
* The immediate next step for the POC is to further refine the self-shadowing logic for front-facing triangles to correctly identify and mark occlusions caused by other parts of the satellite (e.g., bus shadowing parts of itself, or solar panels shadowing the bus, if applicable by geometry and sun angle). The "Cast Rays with NO Hits" for front-facing bus triangles (when the intersector is the bus itself) needs to be resolved to achieve true self-shadowing.
